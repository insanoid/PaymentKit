# PaymentKit (Minimal design and improved UX)

### Extended features and Improvements

- Bug where the user was not able to enter the last character of an invalid card is solved (the text becomes red now properly when an invalid card is entered instead of not allowing him enter the last character of the invalid card).

- Pre-loading card information in the UI.

- A keyboard accessory toolbar with a Next/Done button to make navigation between fields much more easier than before.

- Bug with entering back to card detail entry mode with a valid card made it impossible to get back to expiry and CVC section without removing a character and entering back again should be resolved with the toolbar

- UI was pretty old, switched to a simple line based design.

- Access to change the color of the line.
